# docker-container-with-a-LAMP-Linux-Apache-Mysql-PHP-setup.
You are required to make a docker container with a LAMP(Linux Apache Mysql PHP) setup. You can use the ubuntu image for Linux.  The idea behind this is simple, you will be making a Web Application deployment environment. To test your environment make a hello world PHP page that can be deployed on the localhost. Make sure you also make a DOCKERFILE for the same.
